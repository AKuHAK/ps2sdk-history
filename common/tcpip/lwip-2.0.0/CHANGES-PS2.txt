Changes to LWIP v2.0.0:
-----------------------

Please keep this file updated, whenever fixes are added or removed. Or if the version of LWIP ported is changed.
As much as I'll like to make a clean port of LWIP, it was clearly not made to support a kernels like our EE and IOP kernels.

1. stdlib.h will not be included in api/netdb.c and core/mem.c, when built for the IOP.
